Solana Legends is more than a meme coin project.  
It is a **mythic narrative** designed to empower the community with:
- Real-time social metrics (Twitter, Telegram, X Community).
- Ritualized design with aura effects and cosmic coherence.
- A philosophy of smart crypto habits: staggered buying/selling, holding with discipline, and embracing **JOMO (Joy of Missing Out)**.

- Ritualize progress: every metric, every update is part of the legend.
